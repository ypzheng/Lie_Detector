<!--
      This resource file maintains application strings. It is recommended that all strings
      intended to be displayed to the user be kept in this file. It is a best practice, as it
      allows strings to be maintained properly and allows the developer to specify translated files
      based on language settings.

      You may need to add strings to this file during your development.
